# welcome to my mapping scripts

here i store most of the scripts that i made for my maps in roblox surf/bhop
this is pretty much just for me to have a place to keep these
i dont want to go through a dozen models to find the most up-to-date script for a map

they are all in Luau (roblox's language derived from lua)
you need to run them in roblox studio for them to work

also i will not be including a list of parts, part names, attributes, etc. required for each script to work
you can use these in your own stuff if you want but please credit me

### anyway thanks i guess
